# Cars Manufactured from 1970-1982 - Data Science (Python)
This project is based on a dataset comprised of information about cars manufactured between 1970-1982 in Europe, Japan, and the United States.
My goal for this project was to categorize cars by different factors of their performance, and then combine these results to decide the best overall vehicle. 
For visualization, I chose to plot the average engine integrity for each country's vehicle and the average engine integrity from 1970-1982.
